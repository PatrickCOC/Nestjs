[doc](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/crud-generator)

* Generate a module (nest g mo) to keep code organized and establish clear boundaries (grouping related components)
* Generate a controller (nest g co) to define CRUD routes (or queries/mutations for GraphQL applications)
* Generate a service (nest g s) to implement & isolate business logic
* Generate an entity class/interface to represent the resource data shape
* Generate Data Transfer Objects (or inputs for GraphQL applications) to define how the data will be sent over the network
